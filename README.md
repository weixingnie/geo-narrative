## Goal of the storymap
I created this map because I want to demonstrate the spatial and physical spread of the coronavirus.
This map take in two parts as important for the map visualization. I tried to combine the subjective fact and objective opinion. I demonstrate the origin, the spread of coronavirus but I also expressed my personal concern for our current health care / medical system. I begin with the story in China, then I draw the connection / the spread all the way to Japan. Especially, the case found in Ginza, which is considered as one of the most dangerous virus appearing at the most popular tourists favored place. Such a future remains unknown but I am deeply worried about the Japanese government or the future of our effort against coronavirus.
